Objective
*   To predict Drug of New Patient using Decision tree Algorithm

About Dataset:
- The data is about a set of patients, all of whom suffered from the same illness. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 medications, Drug A, Drug B, Drug c, Drug x and y. 
- to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same illness. 
- The features of this dataset are :
   - Age,
   - Sex,
   - Blood Pressure,
   - Cholesterol of the patients,
   - and the target is the drug that each patient responded to.
    
- It is a sample of multiclass classifier, and use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree, and then use it to predict the class of an unknown patient, or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.


Accuracy of the Model : 98 %
